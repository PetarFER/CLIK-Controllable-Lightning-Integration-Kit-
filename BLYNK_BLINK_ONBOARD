This code works just like the ordinary CLIK - BLINK_ONBOARD but in this case LED on pin 13 (bulit-in LED) can be controlled
via mobile phone application BLYNK. CLIK user manual can give you more information on how to download, setup and and use BLYNK app.
If you find it hard to understand BLYNK application just from our user manual, you can check out their website http://www.blynk.cc/getting-started/ where
they go into details on how to use blynk.
